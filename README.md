## North Star Metric and Dimensions
- North Star Metric: 30-Day Readmission Rate (10.7% baseline)
- Dimensions:
  - Number of Procedures (0-6)
  - Number of Diagnoses (0-9+)
  - Medical Specialty
  - Time in Hospital (1-14 days)
  - Number of Medications (1-100)
    
## Summary of Insights
### The 1 Procedure Paradox
- Patients with exactly **1 procedure** show a **12.2 readmission rate** - the highest across all procedure count groups.
- This is **21.6% higher** than the overall baseline of 10.7%
- In contrast, patients with **5+ procedures** have **lower** readmission rate (< 10%)

### Diagnosis Complexity Drives Risk
- Higher number of diagnoses corelates with higher readmission risk

### High-Risk Patient Segments
- The combination of **1 procedures + 3 plus diagnoses** creates identifiable high-risk segments

### Top 3 Medical Specialties with Highest Readmission Risk
- 1. Allergy/Immunology
  2. Hermatology
  3. Pediatrics-Hematology-Oncology
